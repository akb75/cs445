brute force- 

hashing o(1) with respect to num of elements

size of the call stack is not your bottle neck
in any of these dfs algorithms that work 
off grids  

it's the incredible number of strings that can 
occur that are generated by a brute force algorithm

generally- start with brute force algo that
allows you to visit every state and then
add a heuristic to prune the space

the better the pruning heuristic the better the soace
you can cut out
