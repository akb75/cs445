definition: head is

head = new node (data, head)

treat that as a head pointer and 
give me the size of that list 

treat the source the index and 
head pointer and feed into a traversal
and count 


node 3
go to array sub 3






mistakes: 

addEdge( src, dest, weight )
edge head = g[src]
//just do a good ole insertAtFront
head = new edge (dest, weight, head);

above is wrong because you are 
modifying the pointer that is
local variable that will go away

loop through input file 
bundle up into an edge and then
insert that edge onto the front
